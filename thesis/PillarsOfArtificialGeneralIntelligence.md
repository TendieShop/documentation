## 1. The Three Laws of Robotics

-   A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
-   A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law
-   A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws
