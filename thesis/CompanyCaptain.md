# Company Captain

There are two types of companies. One type doesn't have a captain while another company does have a captain.

The company with a captain is a company that has a CEO that intends to go down with the ship, while a company without a captain is a company that has a CEO that intends to bail at the first opportunity.

A company with a captain is much more valuable than a company without a captain.
