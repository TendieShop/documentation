## Script

### Exposition

I get it, you hate your boss, your job, and your life. But you are willing to take responsibility and turn your life around in a short amount of time. What I am about to tell you is not financial advice. You looked at all the traditional markets and realized that it would take forever to make any real money unless you get super lucky. After googling how to make money online, you discover the wild crypto markets.

Oh, you poor soul.

The average person would be deterred by the risk of losing 30% in 24hr, but not you. You are a special kind of person, you are a degen. You're looking to go from being a sardine to being a wale in 3 years or less. I am talking life-changing gains, a total transformation in lifestyle.

You look at the markets and the first thing you see is Bitcoin, the currency or store of value, who knows what the heck it stands for at this point. All you know is that it will take about 3 years or so to 10x from here, and ain't nobody got time for that. So you go deeper.

### Rising action

As you dive deeper you discover smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Polkadot, and your degenerate senses are tingling. All kinds of possibilities are laid bare, such as staking to earn passive income. You are also finally able to trade different coins peer to peer using decentralized exchanges also known as a dex, but the discovery of Automated Market Makers or AMM is what piqued your interest. You took on the honorable title of liquidity provider and thus you are introduced to decentralized finance or DeFi.

You play around and learn that you can earn much more than what the banks offer, but with great income comes great wreckage. Indeed you got rekt, you put your money into an Initial Coin Offering also known as an ICO and that was the wrong move. It's essentially an IPO but without regulatory oversite, a special shout-out to the SEC for allowing this for as long as it has. Of course, ICO's weren't degenerate enough and the whole thing has devolved into IDO's and IEO's but I digress.

After careful analysis, and seeing that your funds are dwindling you realize that there are trends, and catching these trends will allow you to ride the wave even if the project you select sucks.

The initial wave was the currency wave, this wave was phenomenal and saw the creation of many bitcoin clones. Many of them added a feature here and there, such as privacy or speed. Perhaps you are familiar with some of them, such as Litecoin.

Then came the smart contract platform wave, this wave changed my life. I put my money in ETH, and I doubled my money in one weekend. After I had spent an eternity in the stock and commodity market, I sold everything and went all in to the crypto market. This wave saw an incredible amount of innovation, all of which was trying to solve ETHs scaling problems. This is when we saw projects such as EOS and Cardano pop up.

The DeFi wave was spawned out of the smart contract wave and saw an incredible amount of innovation as well. This wave challenged traditional financial services by providing much high ROIs.

The current wave, the NFT wave presents an unpreceded opportunity. Practically free projects are now worth millions of dollars. This might of been the first wave I didn't see coming at all, it has truly blown me away. Odds are we are nearing the end of the NFT wave.

So what will be the next wave you ask yourself?

Well, I think that the consensus has been reached that the next wave will be the NFT Gaming wave. Just like how smart contracts have spawned DeFi, I believe that NFTs will spawn Gaming NFTs. This is good and bad news. The good news is that much of this is free to earn, by simply spending your time. The play-to-earn mechanism might be the faires thing I have seen in crypto thus far. The bad news is that you are not a game developer, and thus can easily be fooled by basic games that use purchased assets.

When you catch these waves early, it almost doesn't matter what you put your money into, but never forget to go back to the big daddy BTC, or you get rekt.

### Climax

With this revelation, you go all in, you get lucky and buy several NFTs that 100x in one week. You take profits put 50% into BTC and play with the rest because you have concluded that you are the NFT master.

### Falling action

After several weeks of playing in the NFT marketplace, reality hits you. You lost all your money. Well technically you don't lose money until you sell, but nobody wants to buy the NFTs you got. You fell for the wale trap that created artificial demand for a worthless NFT, and now you are stuck holding the bag with no liquidity insight.

### Denouement

And then you remember, that's right, I put half the gains in BTC. You take a look at your wallet and see that BTC has gone nuts. And you think to yourself, nice, I am back baby.

A special thank you to the patreons, I truly appreciate you.
